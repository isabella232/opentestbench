git clone -b JPEGXSCoreExperiments3Torino2017 https://github.com/uclouvain/opentestbench

bash install.sh ---> it will install difftest, XSM compiled and XSM branches from Canon properly from the SVN

If you want to run compression and PSNR measurements (for instance for E1):
cd E1
bash TOP_run_E1_psnr.sh $path
with $path being a path to a folder containing the following folders:
${path}/ARRI_AlexaDrums_3840x2160p_24_10b_bt709_444_00162 
${path}/Tools_1520x1200_8b 
${path}/HintergrundMusik_1920x1080_8b 
${path}/VQEG_CrowdRun_3840x2160p_50_10b_bt709_422_07111

${path}/RICHTER_ScreenContent2_4096x2160p_60_8b_sRGB_444_00001 
${path}/BLENDER_Sintel2_4096x1744p_24_10b_sRGB_444_00004606

${path}/EBU_PendulusWide_3840x2160p_50_10b_bt709_444_0001

each of this folder contain a single frame, they are available here: 
http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=18854096&objAction=Open&nexturl=%2Flivelink%2Flivelink%3Ffunc%3Dll%26objId%3D18832698%26objAction%3Dbrowse%26viewType%3D1

--> after this step, all the PSNR values for E1 are available in opentestbench/results

If you want to generate the curves using matlab (for instance for E1)
cd E1
bash TOP_graphics_E1.sh psnr --> to generate the RD curves related to XSM configurations with psnr weighting
and 
bash TOP_graphics_E1.sh visual --> to generate the RD curves related to XSM configurations with visual weighting

--> after this step the PSNR curves are available in E1/graphics

If you want to generate the Bjontegaard BD-PSNR and BD-rate (for instance for E1):
cd E1
python TOP_Bjontegaard_E1.py psnr
and 
python TOP_Bjontegaard_E1.py visual

--> after this step, the tables with BD-PSNR and BD-rate are in the E1/Bjontegaard folder
