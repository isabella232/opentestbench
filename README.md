------------------------------------

Experiment types:

- singlegen : simple encoding/decoding of a set of pictures and PSNR computations wrt the original picture
- multigen : several consecutive encoding/decoding of a set of pictures and PSNR computations after each iteration wrt the original picture
- errortest : a single bit-flip at a random position is inserted in the bitstream before decoding and PSNR computations wrt the original picture

------------------------------------

Currently supported codecs :

- JP2K ULL
- JP2K ULLC
- VC-2 LD
- VC-2 HQCBR
- JPEG (with pseudo-CBR mode)
- JPEG LS (with pseudo-CBR mode)
- DSC
- HEVC HM (with pseudo-CBR mode)

------------------------------------

Currently supported image formats :

- RGB 4:4:4 8b, 10b and 12b in PPM files
- YCbCr 4:2:2 10b and 12b in RAW planar 16-bit little-endian files

-----------------------------------

Instructions :

1. Go to the opentestbench folder.
2. If you have a version of DSC (i.e. DSC_model_201407151.zip) put the zip file in opentestbench/codecs/DSC
3. To be able to make vc2-reference work, libboost must be installed (http://www.boost.org/)
4. Run bash install.sh.
5. Configure the experiment by editing run.sh.
6. Run bash run.sh.
7. Observe the results in the "results" folder.
8. Graphs can be generated automatically using matlab by modifying and running run_graphics.sh (work in progress)
9. Observe the results in the "graphics" folder.

-----------------------------------

Instructions to add a new codec: 

1. Modify the encapsulator benchmark/prototype/prototype.sh to add your encoder and decoder command lines for RGB 8b and YCbCr 4:2:2 10b (can be generalized for other bit depths)
2. Take example from benchmark/vc2ld/vc2ld.sh if you want to know how to do format conversion using difftest_ng
3. Do not hesitate to ask support if needed

-----------------------------------

Desinstallation:

1. opentestbench installs all required software locally. Deleting the opentestbench/build folder undo the effect of install.sh

-----------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTES : 

- the boost library must be installed manually (for instance http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0.tar.gz/download)
- opentestbench works only on Linux.
