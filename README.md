This framework allows one to reproduce the results obtained in the article "Quality and error robustness assessment of low-latency
lightweight intra-frame codecs".

Steps to obtain the results : 

1) Execute the operations described in the "TO_PUT_HERE.txt" files in conversion_tools, DSC, ebuv210, error_insertion_1bit, JP2K, TICO and v210_tools directories.

2) Go to the benchmark_scripts folder and modify the paths to the several folders in the paths.sh script.

3) Execute chart1.sh to obtain the results shown on figures 3 in the article. The results are written in the dstDSC422, dstJ2KULL422, dstJ2KULLC422 and dstTICO422 folders.

4) Execute chart2.sh to obtain the results shown on figures 4 in the article. The results are written in the dstDSC422, dstJ2KULL422, dstJ2KULLC422 and dstTICO422 folders.

5) Execute chart3.sh to obtain the results shown on figures 5 in the article. The results are written in the dstDSC422MG, dstJ2KULL422MG, dstJ2KULLC422MG and dstTICO422MG folders.

6) Execute chart4.sh to obtain the results shown on figures 6 in the article. The results are written in the dstDSC422error, dstJ2KULL422error, dstJ2KULLC422error and dstTICO422error folders.
