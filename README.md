------------------------------------

Experiment types:

- singlegen : simple encoding/decoding of a set of pictures and PSNR computations wrt the original picture
- multigen : several consecutive encoding/decoding of a set of pictures and PSNR computations after each iteration wrt the original picture
- errortest : a single bit-flip at a random position is inserted in the bitstream before decoding and PSNR computations wrt the original picture

------------------------------------

Currently supported codecs :

- JP2K ULL
- JP2K ULLC

------------------------------------

Currently supported image formats :

- RGB 4:4:4 8b
- YCbCr 4:2:2 10b

-----------------------------------
