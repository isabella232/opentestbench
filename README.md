IMPORTANT NOTES : 

- The scripts have only been tested on Centos

- The moving sequences for JPEG XS CE5 will require around 1 TB

- These scripts require:
1. ffmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. cmake (https://cmake.org/download/)
------------------------------------

How to generate the moving sequences JPEG XS CE5:

1. git clone https://github.com/uclouvain/opentestbench
2. git checkout JPEGXSCoreExperiments5Rio2018_moving_seqs_generation 
3. bash install.sh --> install all the required software in the /build folder
4. Modify ${path} in run_compression.sh and run_subj_seqs.sh in order to specify the path to the directory that contains the sequences (one sub-directory per sequence, namely VQEG_ParkJoy_3840x2160p_50_10b_bt709_422, BLENDER_Sintel2_4096x1744p_24_10b_sRGB_444 and APPLE_BasketBallScreen_2560x1440p_60_8b_sRGB_444)
5. Run these command lines (if possible, simultaneously in different terminals):
  - "bash run_compression.sh ce5_main"
  - "bash run_compression.sh ce5_high"
  - "bash run_compression.sh ce5_low_memory"
  - "bash run_compression.sh ce5_low_logic"
6. The decompressed frames are available in the /results folder
7. To generate the sequences run these command lines (if possible, simultaneously in different terminals):
  - "bash run_subj_seqs.sh ce5_main"
  - "bash run_subj_seqs.sh ce5_high"
  - "bash run_subj_seqs.sh ce5_low_memory"
  - "bash run_subj_seqs.sh ce5_low_logic"
8. The movs are available in the preprocessed_materials/seqs folder

  
Uninstall:

1. opentestbench installs all required software locally. Deleting the opentestbench/build folder undo the effect of install.sh
